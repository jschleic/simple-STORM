Installing storm / storm-gui

Prerequisites for the command-line utility:
  vigra >= 1.8.0
  fftw  >= 3.0
  openmp (recommended for parallelization)
  hdf5 (recommended for hdf5 input)

Prerequisites for the graphical-user-interface (GUI):

This package uses a CMake-based build system.
In the easiest case you can build and install the software 
by running (inside the storm or gui folder respectively):
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
  make
  make install

The packages mentioned above should be installed first
and are detected automatically by the CMake-scripts.
